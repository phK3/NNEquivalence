# NNEquivalence # 

Tool to encode the equivalence problem for NNs as MILP.

## Requirements ##

The tool is written in Python 3.6

This tool uses version 8.1.1 of the Gurobi solver to solve the resulting MILP instances.
The website of Gurobi can be found [here](https://www.gurobi.com/ "Gurobi Website"), they offer free academic licenses for their software.

Instructions on how the gurobipy module can be installed can be found at the end of the [uickstart guide](https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/8.1/quickstart_mac/py_building_and_running_th.html).

Several other python modules are needed, in order to use all functionality. 
Among them are numpy, pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, h5py, texttable and sklearn, I might have missed modules, that were already present in my environment however.

Jupyter is needed to run Jupyter notebooks.
